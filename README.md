# 4G Surveillance Drone (prototype)
###### By Oluwafemi Oreoluwa
In the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering, I took it upon myself to build something I never thought I could and, ultimately, something that could improve how we live our lives in some way or form. A 4G Surveillance drone. In October 2021, I began the engineering design of this e-UAV and completed implementation four days to defense.
This project aimed to reduce CO2 emissions contributed during aerial surveillance in the aviation industry by introducing a Network of electric 4G Surveillance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
