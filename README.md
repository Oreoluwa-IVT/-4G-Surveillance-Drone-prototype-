# 4G Surveillance Drone (prototype)
###### By Oluwafemi Oreoluwa
This repository contains all the resources and procedures needed to design and implement a Wireless 4G Surveillance UAV. 
Getting Started, it is important to know that this repository is sectioned in 5 folders: Circuit Design , 3D Model , Code , Components and Documentation. However, 
to followthrough , you'd need to be consersant with the Scripting Lanaguage, Python. If you're new to python, no fear , it's easy to learn.
This Read Me will give a summary of this project and will act a guide for navigating your way around this repository.
